The goal of this project was simple: I want a numpad. Unfortunately, it was rapidly complicated by just a couple criteria.

The first additional criteria is that it had to be wireless. Due to my class schedule, I am constantly moving around campus. Thus, everything that I need to use must be able to fit into my backpack. This doesn't make wireless strictly necessary, but when the time spent at a desk is 30 minutes, it becomes difficult to justify taking out a cable just to use a numpad. A wireless numpad, however, that just requires the flick of a switch to turn on, encourages the usage of the numpad.

The next additional criteria is it has to use mechanical switches.

The final criteria is that it had to charge and connect with USB-C.
