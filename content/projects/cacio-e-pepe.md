## Introduction
Cacio e pepe is a simple recipe made of three ingredients: pasta, cheese, and black pepper.

However, the simplicity of the recipe does not obsolve the cook from challenges. The goal of the recipe is to make a creme like sauce out of just the pasta water and cheese. However, the cheese has a tendency of clumping, ruining the desired smooth texture.

This clumping is caused by two things: high temperature and starch deficiency.[^Bartolucci]

The quickest and easiest way to get a reliable smooth sauce is to cook the pasta in a frying pan. This increases the starch concentration, preventing the clumping.

## Ingredients
### Pasta
This one is probably the least important to some and more important to others. For some, the pasta is just the medium of transport between the sauce and your taste buds. In this case, if one is being particularly picky, bronze die-cut pasta has a rougher texture on the surface. This does two things for the pasta. First, it increases the surface area that the sauce can cling onto. Second, the pasta releases more starch into the water. This can both increase the sauce per bite and enhance the sauce. However, its more niche the U.S.A., making it slightly more expensive and much harder to find. You can purchase it online.
### Cheese
The traditional cheese to use is *pecorino romano*, or sheep's cheese of Rome, which is quite salty. Pecorino romano is also a bit more expensive, potentially becuase it has a protected designation of origin by European Union law (though not sure how much that matters for U.S.A. customers).
### Black Pepper
### Others
Though cacio e pepe is delicious on its own, there are some things you can add that enrich the flavor, or add more nutrition to the meal.

**Butter**: a bit sacrilege, but supposedly tasty.
