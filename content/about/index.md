Through high school and early college, I focused mainly on music, in particular violin and piano. Music is a wonderful undertaking, as it's always engauging, and it taught me how to work hard and develop skills. Also early in my college career I became invested in Blender and 3D modelling and animation. Though just an amateur, through the process of creating an artifical reality, I've gained a deeper appreciation and understanding of the reality we go through everyday.

Currently, I'm focused on learning the fundamentals of physics and engineering. Physics provides a foundational understanding of the world, and engineering gives the tools required to make things that you require and desire. I enjoy making things that help me understand how the world works, and using my understanding of how the world works to help me make things.
