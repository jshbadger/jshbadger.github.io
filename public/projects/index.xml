      <description>&lt;p&gt;One line summary: A guide to setup Sway on Windows through WSL&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;0-prerequisite-notes&#34;&gt;0. Prerequisite Notes&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This guide assumes a basic understanding of using terminals. Hypothetically, a complete novice &lt;em&gt;could&lt;/em&gt; follow this guide successfully, but it would be strange for a complete novice to be interested in installing &lt;a href=&#34;https://swaywm.org/&#34;&gt;Sway&lt;/a&gt;. Perhaps the novice reader stumbled on this guide and is curious what it is about. For this curious reader, you are free to read through the guide, though I suggest going through Software Carpentry&amp;rsquo;s &lt;a href=&#34;https://swcarpentry.github.io/shell-novice/&#34;&gt;The Unix Shell&lt;/a&gt; lesson before seriously considering setting up Sway.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>DIY Numpad</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The goal of this project was simple: I want a numpad. Unfortunately, it was rapidly complicated by just a couple criteria.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The first additional criteria is that it had to be wireless. Due to my class schedule, I am constantly moving around campus. Thus, everything that I need to use must be able to fit into my backpack. This doesn&amp;rsquo;t make wireless strictly necessary, but when the time spent at a desk is 30 minutes, it becomes difficult to justify taking out a cable just to use a numpad. A wireless numpad, however, that just requires the flick of a switch to turn on, encourages the usage of the numpad.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
