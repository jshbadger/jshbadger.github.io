      <description>&lt;p&gt;The goal of this project was simple: I want a numpad. Unfortunately, it was rapidly complicated by just a couple criteria.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The first additional criteria is that it had to be wireless. Due to my class schedule, I am constantly moving around campus. Thus, everything that I need to use must be able to fit into my backpack. This doesn&amp;rsquo;t make wireless strictly necessary, but when the time spent at a desk is 30 minutes, it becomes difficult to justify taking out a cable just to use a numpad. A wireless numpad, however, that just requires the flick of a switch to turn on, encourages the usage of the numpad.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
