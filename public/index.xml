      <description>&lt;p&gt;Through high school and early college, I focused mainly on music, in particular violin and piano. Music is a wonderful undertaking, as it&amp;rsquo;s always engauging, and it taught me how to work hard and develop skills. Also early in my college career I became invested in Blender and 3D modelling and animation. Though just an amateur, through the process of creating an artifical reality, I&amp;rsquo;ve gained a deeper appreciation and understanding of the reality we go through everyday.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I intentionally avoid social media. Thus, if you wish to reach out to me, the easiest way will likely be &lt;a href=&#34;mailto:stewar.jacob@proton.me&#34;&gt;email&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If you would like to meet with me, you can schedule an appointment through &lt;a href=&#34;https://cal.com/jacobst&#34;&gt;Cal.com&lt;/a&gt;. In the appointment, please specify how you would like to meet (in-person, Zoom, or if you&amp;rsquo;re willing to experiment with me, Cal&amp;rsquo;s built in video conferencing service). If you would like to meet for longer than 30 minutes, please email me and we can arrange the time and place. Please arranage the appointment the day before, as if you arrange the meeting the day of, I can&amp;rsquo;t guarantee that I will be available for the meeting.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
