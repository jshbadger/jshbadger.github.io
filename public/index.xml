      <description>&lt;p&gt;One line summary: A guide to setup Sway on Windows through WSL&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;0-prerequisite-notes&#34;&gt;0. Prerequisite Notes&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This guide assumes a basic understanding of using terminals. Hypothetically, a complete novice &lt;em&gt;could&lt;/em&gt; follow this guide successfully, but it would be strange for a complete novice to be interested in installing &lt;a href=&#34;https://swaywm.org/&#34;&gt;Sway&lt;/a&gt;. Perhaps the novice reader stumbled on this guide and is curious what it is about. For this curious reader, you are free to read through the guide, though I suggest going through Software Carpentry&amp;rsquo;s &lt;a href=&#34;https://swcarpentry.github.io/shell-novice/&#34;&gt;The Unix Shell&lt;/a&gt; lesson before seriously considering setting up Sway.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>DIY Numpad</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The goal of this project was simple: I want a numpad. Unfortunately, it was rapidly complicated by just a couple criteria.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The first additional criteria is that it had to be wireless. Due to my class schedule, I am constantly moving around campus. Thus, everything that I need to use must be able to fit into my backpack. This doesn&amp;rsquo;t make wireless strictly necessary, but when the time spent at a desk is 30 minutes, it becomes difficult to justify taking out a cable just to use a numpad. A wireless numpad, however, that just requires the flick of a switch to turn on, encourages the usage of the numpad.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Through high school and early college, I focused mainly on music, in particular violin and piano. Music is a wonderful undertaking, as it&amp;rsquo;s always engauging, and it taught me how to work hard and develop skills. Also early in my college career I became invested in Blender and 3D modelling and animation. Though just an amateur, through the process of creating an artifical reality, I&amp;rsquo;ve gained a deeper appreciation and understanding of the reality we go through everyday.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I intentionally avoid social media. Thus, if you wish to reach out to me, the easiest way will likely be &lt;a href=&#34;mailto:stewar.jacob@proton.me&#34;&gt;email&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If you would like to meet with me, you can schedule an appointment through &lt;a href=&#34;https://cal.com/jacobst&#34;&gt;Cal.com&lt;/a&gt;. In the appointment, please specify how you would like to meet (in-person, Zoom, or if you&amp;rsquo;re willing to experiment with me, Cal&amp;rsquo;s built in video conferencing service). If you would like to meet for longer than 30 minutes, please email me and we can arrange the time and place. Please arrange the appointment the day before, as if you arrange the meeting the day of, I can&amp;rsquo;t guarantee that I will be available for the meeting.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
